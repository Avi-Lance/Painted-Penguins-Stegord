Ensure you have Python3 installed on your system. 
We haven't tested which versions of Python do and do not work but we developed it in python3.10.

Then you need to run setup[.sh/.psh.bat] depending on your OS.
Note, all it is doing is installing the dependencies in requirements.txt with python3.

Then run the Electron installer and it should work.
