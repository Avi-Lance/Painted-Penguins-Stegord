# Stegord: A Secure Messaging Platform

The purpose of this app is to provide communication in a secure way. Stegord users will be able to send and recive messages from other Stegord users with the reassurance that their messages are being hidden using steganography.

Users can customize their profile with a bio and picture. Alongside messaging, users can also make connections by friending other Stegord users.
